Debian Install ISO

When installing Debian and requiring a network installation medium, download the following link.

<CodeBlock>
```
{{http_protocol}}{{mirror}}/current/amd64/iso-cd/
```
</CodeBlock>

Choose the file ending with ``amd64-netinst.iso``.

If you need to install a desktop environment offline, in

<CodeBlock>
```
{{http_protocol}}{{mirror}}/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/
```
</CodeBlock>

you can choose the `debian-live-xxx-amd64-xxx.iso` file for different desktops, such as the file `debian-live-12.1.0-amd64-lxqt.iso`, which contains the necessary content for offline installation of Debian with the 12.1.0 version, amd64 architecture, and lxqt desktop.
