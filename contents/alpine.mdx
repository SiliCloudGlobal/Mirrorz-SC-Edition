Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on the musl libc and busybox projects.

Enter the following commands in the terminal to replace the mirror source:

<CodeBlock>

```bash
sed -i 's#https\?://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine#{{http_protocol}}{{mirror}}#g' /etc/apk/repositories
```

</CodeBlock>

Alternatively, you can directly edit the `/etc/apk/repositories` file. The following is a reference configuration for version 3.5:


<CodeBlock>

```
{{http_protocol}}{{mirror}}/v3.5/main
{{http_protocol}}{{mirror}}/v3.5/community
```

</CodeBlock>

You can also use `latest-stable` to point to the latest stable version:


<CodeBlock>

```
{{http_protocol}}{{mirror}}/latest-stable/main
{{http_protocol}}{{mirror}}/latest-stable/community
```

</CodeBlock>

After modifying the `/etc/apk/repositories` file, please run `apk update` to refresh the index and apply the changes.
