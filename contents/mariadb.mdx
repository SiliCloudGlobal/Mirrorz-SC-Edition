Due to various MariaDB versions, it's recommended to generate the configuration file content on the [official website](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories).

### Debian/Ubuntu Based on apt 


Create `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/MariaDB.list`, Fill in the config content generated by the tool, including the address part, for example:

```
https://apt.mariadb.org/mariadb/repo
```

Replace with

<CodeBlock>

```
{{http_protocol}}{{mirror}}/repo
```

</CodeBlock>

### RHEL/CentOS Based on yum

Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/MariaDB.repo`, Fill in the generated configuration and replace the address portion after `baseurl=`, for example:

```
http://yum.mariadb.org
```

Replace with

<CodeBlock>

```
{{http_protocol}}{{mirror}}/yum
```

</CodeBlock>
